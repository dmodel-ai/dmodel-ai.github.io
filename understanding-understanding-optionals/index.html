<div class="abstract-title">Abstract</div>
Large language models have demonstrated impressive emergent
capabilities, including the ability to write code, but this ability
requires a model of program semantics that is little understood. Recent
interpretability work has shown the ability to extract internal
representations of natural language concepts, raising the possibility
that similar techniques could be used to extract program semantics
concepts. In this work we study how large language models represent
nullability of program values. We measure how well models of various
sizes complete programs that use nullable values, and then extract an
internal representation of nullability.
</div>

<h1 data-number="1" id="introduction"><span
class="header-section-number">1</span> Introduction</h1>
<p>The last five years have shown us that Large Language Models can
effectively write programs in many
domains.<span class="aside AT">AT: cite</span> This is an impressive
capability given that writing programs involves having a working
understanding of many aspects of their semantics. But though we know
that these large models understand programs to an extent, we still don’t
know what form that understanding takes; where it has a deep
understanding and where it uses heuristic reasoning, how it represents
program knowledge, and what kinds of situations will challenge its
capabilities.</p>
<p>Fortunately, recent work in model interpretability and representation
engineering<span class="aside AT">AT: which work?</span> has produced
promising results which give hope towards understanding more and more of
the internal thought processes of LLMs. Here at <span
class="math inline">\(d_{model}\)</span> , we can think of no better
place to apply these new techniques than program understanding, where
there are many abstract properties that can be symbolically determined.
The vast work done in programming language theory over the past hundred
years provides many tools for scaling an understanding of the internal
thought processes of language models as they write
code.<span class="aside AT">AT: for examples, see cite, cite</span></p>
<p>In that spirit, we wanted to start with a simple property that comes
up in every programming languages, nullability. Nullable values are
represented differently across languages, null pointers in C++ or Java,
with explicit Option types in Rust, and with special nil or None values
in dynamic languages like Javascript, Lisp, or Python. In every case,
understanding where values can be nullable is necessary for even their
most basic uses, and misunderstanding where they are nullable can often
be a source of bugs, like a null pointer dereference.</p>
<p>Do our models understand when a value is nullable? They must, to be
able to write code that deals with nullable values, but we haven’t known
what form this knowledge takes, what situations are likely to confuse
the model. Until now.<span class=aside>big claim!</span></p>
<p>In this work, we contribute:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>A microbenchmark of 15 programs that test basic model
understanding of the flow of nullability through a program (sec. <a
href="#sec:bench">3</a>).</p></li>
<li><p>We find show that models develop an internal concept of
nullability as they scale up and are trained for longer. (sec. <a
href="#sec:probing">4</a>)</p></li>
<li><p>We find that models begin to understand nullability in a local
scope, satisfying many requirements of the python typechecker, before
they start to understand how nullability flows across the program.
(sec. <a href="#sec:grok">3.1</a>, sec. <a href="#sec:results">5</a>)
<span class="aside AT">AT: eventually we add the contribution about typing rules</span></p></li>
</ul>
<h1 data-number="2" id="overview"><span
class="header-section-number">2</span> Overview</h1>
<p>Understanding the flow of nullability across programs is an essential
part of writing most code, and misunderstandings are often a source of
bugs. For models to write code, they must learn to track nullability in
some form. In this work, we’ll explore ways to measure nullability
understanding in language models, and use that to show how the
understanding of nullability changes over various model parameters.</p>
<p>Lets say you’re writing a Python program with your LLM assistant.
You’ve reached some point where you need to do something with a variable
called <code>num</code>. Maybe you’re building a list of numbers called
<code>positive_nums</code>. How do you proceed?</p>
<p>The answer often depends on the context in which you’re working. If
<code>num</code> and <code>positive_nums</code> are the things in scope,
then you might guess that you should write the lines:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb1"><pre
class="sourceCode python"><code class="sourceCode python"><span id="cb1-1"><a href="#cb1-1" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a><span class="cf">if</span> num <span class="op">&gt;</span> <span class="dv">0</span>:</span>
<span id="cb1-2"><a href="#cb1-2" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a>  positive_nums.append(num)</span></code></pre></div>
<p>And if <code>num</code> is always a concrete number, as its name
would suggest, then this is probably the correct code. But variable
names don’t alway convey everything important about them, and it might
be the case that <code>num</code> could be None. If so, you’ll instead
want to write:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb2"><pre
class="sourceCode python"><code class="sourceCode python"><span id="cb2-1"><a href="#cb2-1" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a><span class="cf">if</span> num <span class="kw">is</span> <span class="kw">not</span> <span class="va">None</span> <span class="kw">and</span> num <span class="op">&gt;</span> <span class="dv">0</span>:</span>
<span id="cb2-2"><a href="#cb2-2" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a>  positive_nums.append(num)</span></code></pre></div>
<p>In this case, the way you want to use <code>num</code> depends on
whether it could be None or not. That is, whether <code>num</code> is
“nullable”. In Python that means having an Optional type
(<code>Optional[int]</code> rather than <code>int</code>).</p>
<p>Determining whether <code>num</code> is nullable in this context
amounts to <em>type inference</em>, and it can be quite complicated in
the worst case. Fortunately, in many cases it’s quite simple, involving
applying just a few rules. For instance, if <code>num</code> is the
parameter to a function you’re inside, and the function declares the
type of <code>num</code> in its parameter list, then you can determine
nullability from that type. So, if your context is:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb3"><pre
class="sourceCode python"><code class="sourceCode python"><span id="cb3-1"><a href="#cb3-1" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a><span class="kw">def</span> foo(num: <span class="bu">int</span>):</span>
<span id="cb3-2"><a href="#cb3-2" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a>    positive_nums: <span class="bu">list</span>[<span class="bu">int</span>] <span class="op">=</span> []</span>
<span id="cb3-3"><a href="#cb3-3" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a>    <span class="cf">if</span> num...</span></code></pre></div>
<p>then you know you don’t need to check for None, whereas if it’s:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb4"><pre
class="sourceCode python"><code class="sourceCode python"><span id="cb4-1"><a href="#cb4-1" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a><span class="kw">def</span> foo(num: Optional[<span class="bu">int</span>]):</span>
<span id="cb4-2"><a href="#cb4-2" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a>    positive_nums: <span class="bu">list</span>[<span class="bu">int</span>] <span class="op">=</span> []</span>
<span id="cb4-3"><a href="#cb4-3" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a>    <span class="cf">if</span> num...</span></code></pre></div>
<p>then you know you <em>do</em> need a None check.</p>
<p>You could instead just ask your LLM assistant to complete the line.
But how does your assistant know if <code>num</code> is nullable? Our
experiments show that LLMs learn to approximate the same typing rules,
by analyzing millions of programs.</p>
<p>If we ask an LLM early in it’s pre-training process to complete the
program above, it produces:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb5"><pre
class="sourceCode python"><code class="sourceCode python"><span id="cb5-1"><a href="#cb5-1" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a><span class="kw">def</span> foo(num: Optional[<span class="bu">int</span>]):</span>
<span id="cb5-2"><a href="#cb5-2" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a>    positive_nums: <span class="bu">list</span>[<span class="bu">int</span>] <span class="op">=</span> []</span>
<span id="cb5-3"><a href="#cb5-3" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a>    <span class="cf">if</span> num.is_a():</span>
<span id="cb5-4"><a href="#cb5-4" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a>        ...</span></code></pre></div>
<p>This is correct Python syntax, but it only works if <code>num</code>
is an object with a <code>is_a()</code> method, instead of an optional
integer.</p>
<p>Train the LLM for a little longer, and it’ll produce:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb6"><pre
class="sourceCode python"><code class="sourceCode python"><span id="cb6-1"><a href="#cb6-1" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a><span class="kw">def</span> foo(num: Optional[<span class="bu">int</span>]):</span>
<span id="cb6-2"><a href="#cb6-2" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a>    positive_nums: <span class="bu">list</span>[<span class="bu">int</span>] <span class="op">=</span> []</span>
<span id="cb6-3"><a href="#cb6-3" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a>    <span class="cf">if</span> num <span class="op">&gt;</span> <span class="dv">0</span>:</span>
<span id="cb6-4"><a href="#cb6-4" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a>        ...</span></code></pre></div>
<p>This is closer, in that its figured out that <code>num</code> is a
number instead of an object, but it still isn’t reading the function
type signature and realizing that <code>num</code> could be None. Keep
training it though, and eventually it will learn to insert the None test
depending on the type signature of the function.</p>
<p>This rule is pretty simple alone, so relatively small models can
learn it, relatively early in their pre-training process. Other, more
complicated rules can take a little longer to learn. For instance, if
your program is:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb7"><pre
class="sourceCode python"><code class="sourceCode python"><span id="cb7-1"><a href="#cb7-1" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a><span class="cf">if</span> condition():</span>
<span id="cb7-2"><a href="#cb7-2" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a>   num <span class="op">=</span> <span class="dv">7</span></span>
<span id="cb7-3"><a href="#cb7-3" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a><span class="cf">else</span>:</span>
<span id="cb7-4"><a href="#cb7-4" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a>   num <span class="op">=</span> <span class="dv">9</span></span>
<span id="cb7-5"><a href="#cb7-5" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a>...</span>
<span id="cb7-6"><a href="#cb7-6" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a><span class="cf">if</span> num...</span></code></pre></div>
<p>then <code>num</code> is a non-nullable number, and you can complete
the condition with <code>&lt; 0</code>.</p>
<p>But if instead you’re dealing with</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb8"><pre
class="sourceCode python"><code class="sourceCode python"><span id="cb8-1"><a href="#cb8-1" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a><span class="cf">if</span> condition():</span>
<span id="cb8-2"><a href="#cb8-2" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a>   num <span class="op">=</span> <span class="dv">7</span></span>
<span id="cb8-3"><a href="#cb8-3" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a><span class="cf">else</span>:</span>
<span id="cb8-4"><a href="#cb8-4" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a>   num <span class="op">=</span> <span class="va">None</span></span>
<span id="cb8-5"><a href="#cb8-5" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a>...</span>
<span id="cb8-6"><a href="#cb8-6" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a><span class="cf">if</span> num...</span></code></pre></div>
<p>Then you’ll want a None check first.</p>
<p>This rule takes models a little longer to learn, but your
highly-trained LLM assistant should make quick work of it. Our
experiments show that as these rules get more and more complex, it takes
LLMs longer and longer to learn them, and it also takes LLMs of more and
more parameters to learn them at all.</p>
<p>We can measure whether LLMs understand these rules by just asking for
completions, what we call an “external” measurement of the models
understanding. But there are many places where variables appear where a
completion won’t tell you what type the model thinks the variable has.
We would still like to know whether the model thinks these variables are
nullable at those locations, so we can instead look for an “internal”
measurement of the models understanding.</p>
<p>We do so by looking at the activations of the model, meaning the
values of each perceptron in the hidden layers. Together, these values
give the entire internal state of the model at each token, and they can
tell us what the model is “thinking” when processing that token. With
the right tests, we can tell if the model is “thinking” that the current
token is an optional variable, or a non-optional variable.</p>
<span class=aside>READING DIAGRAMS HERE</span>
<p>In Section [SECTION] we’ll describe our external tests of nullability
understanding in more detail, and in Section [SECTION] we’ll describe
measuring the models internal states in detail. Finally, we’ll go over
some related work, and present final experiments.</p>
<h1 data-number="3" id="sec:bench"><span
class="header-section-number">3</span> Measuring Nullability
Understanding
Externally<span class="aside AT">AT: Externally = token-level?</span></h1>
<p>We begin by measuring model nullability understanding externally,
because it provides a “skyline” or upper-bound estimate on our ability
to extract internal concepts of nullability. To do this, we have the
model complete simple partial programs that require an understanding of
nullability.</p>
<p>But before we do, we’ll want to be more precise about exactly what
we’re measuring. To that end, we’ll take the notion of different “rules”
for nullability that we discuseed informally in the overview, and bring
it into a formal typing system. We’re not going to try to describe all
the typing rules of python, so we’ll restrict ourselves in three
dimensions.</p>
<p>First, we’ll reduce the number of python features that we handle by
actually working in a subset of python. This means we can skip worrying
about the semantics of complicated features, and just focus on the
features neccesary for understanding optionality in a semi-realistic
setting.</p>
<p>Second, we’ll define all non-None values as converting to the boolean
value True, instead of numbers converting to False when they are zero
and strings converting to False when they are empty. This is a necessary
practicality, because otherwise, the model could circumvent our type
tests by doing bare ifs which work on both optional and non-optional
types. But to prevent bare ifs from ever being the correct completion
for a non-optional type, we’ll design our tests so that there are never
any values that would convert to False, namely the number zero and the
empty string. <span class="aside AS">AS: Some of the following
should probably go in the appendix</span></p>

<p>We won’t worry too much about the semantics on a formal level, since
it’s the same as Python’s semantics on this subset, and we’ll mostly be
using it informally to justify typing rules here. But we do want to
formally define our typing rules, since we’ll be measuring the models
understanding of particular rules. We’ll be using two propositions for
typing in this language. There’s <span class="math inline">\(\Gamma

<p>The rules above are sufficient for our purposes for dealing with
fully type annotated programs. But what about programs with functions
that aren’t type annotated, or are only partially annotated? The mypy
type system that Python uses treats unannotated functions as dynamically
typed, allowing them to typecheck as any type. Similarly, function
parameters without a type annotation are implicitly convertable to any
type. So, for normaly mypy typechecking, we add the following typing
rules:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[\begin{gather}
\Gamma, x_0 : Any, x_1 : Any, ... \vdash [b] \vartriangleright
\text{ok}\\
\tag{DynDef}
\Gamma, f : Any \rightarrow ... \rightarrow Any \vdash [p]
\vartriangleright \text{ok}
\over
\Gamma \vdash
\left[\begin{array}{l}
\texttt{def $f$($x_0$, $x_1$, ...):}\\
\quad b\\
p
\end{array}\right]
\vartriangleright \text{ok}
\end{gather}\]</span></p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
\tag{DynConvert}
\frac{\Gamma \vdash x : t}
     {\Gamma \vdash x : Any}
     \hspace{0.5cm}
\frac{\Gamma \vdash x : Any}
     {\Gamma \vdash x : t}
\]</span></p>
<p>These rules allow more python programs to check statically, but they
mean that some python programs will pass the static checks but still
throw type errors at runtime. Importantly for us, they can throw runtime
type errors about optionality. A well-written piece of code would not
just satisfy this type system then, but actually a stronger one that
would prevent runtime type errors. We’ll call this stronger type system
mypy++. Instead of the Dyn- rules, it has this one:</p>

<p>We begin with a “skyline” estimate of model understanding of
nullability (a la <span class="citation" data-cites="feng24binding">Feng
and Steinhardt (2024)</span>). We measure how well different models can
understand the concept. To do this, we have the model complete simple
partial programs that require an understanding of nullability. We refer
to this suite of programs as <code>NullabilityEval</code>. For
example,</p>

<p>This test is on the simpler side, but we can challenge the model
more, adding layers of indirection between the source and sink of
nullable values, testing the model’s <em>interprocedural</em>
understanding.</p>
<p>We can also test how well models understand type annotations
separately; since the inclusion of type annotations in Python is not
required<a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>4</sup></a>, most of the Python code used as

the dynamic flow of nullable values but not their static type
annotations. Test 5, below, tests the model’s understanding of
<code>Optional</code> types annotations. The trailing colon makes a type

<h2 data-number="3.1" id="sec:grok"><span
class="header-section-number">3.1</span> Local vs Non-Local Type
Correctness</h2>
<p>For most of our tests, writing correct code simply requires following
the rules of Python’s mypy type system. This type system requires that
types be internally consistent within functions, and match function type
signatures if they exist. But six of our tests are different, because
they involve functions that are <em>not</em> annotated with type
signatures. Under mypy, these functions are allowed to do almost
anything with their types. But at runtime, using values of the wrong
type with these functions will result in a type error.</p>
<span class="aside AT">AT: too many clauses!</span>
<p>You could strengthen mypy’s type rules to require that these untyped
functions have some valid type they could be assigned which would cause
the function to typecheck. This would prevent programs that pass the
typechecker from having runtime type errors. We can call this
strengthened type system mypy+.</p>
<p>Since mypy+ has strictly more typing rules than mypy, we would expect
the model to take longer to learn how to satisfy it. And indeed this is
the case: We find that models learn to satisfy the mypy typechecker</p>
<p>One explanation of why the model gets worse before it gets better is
that the model first learns the concepts need to solve the task, then
learns the language of python — its syntax, static (under mypy), and
dynamic semantics, and then both.
<span class="aside AT">AT: cite something here. grokking, double descent, interp?</span>
Let’s make this more concrete.</p>
<p>We say a model produces an answer that is “morally” (vs technically)
correct if the code attempts to solve the problem asked of it. Each test
case is paired with a regex that tests if the model output produces code
that touches all of the relevant concepts.
<span class="aside AS">AS: put an example here?</span> Here, we say the
solution is “technically” correct if it passes <code>mypy</code>.</p>

class="header-section-number">4.1</span> Designing Prompts to Extract
Nullability Activations</h2>
<span class=aside>we can probably just make this a brief part of the related work</span>
<p>At this point, we’ve figured out how to roughly measure nullability
understanding in the output of various language models, but we still
don’t know what their internal representations might look like or when
they emerge. To do this, we’re going to bring in some ideas described in
Zhou et al’s paper <a
href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.01405">“Representation Engineering: A
Top-Down Approach to AI Transparency”</a>.</p>
<p>As language models predict each token in a text, they run their tuned
circuits over all the previous text. Tokens are first embedded into a
high-dimensional “token space”, and each layer of the transformer model
is made up of many parallel circuits which transform the previous layers
output into new embeddings in a new space. Each layer can look not just
at the output of the layer directly previous, but actually all previous
layers, through a channel called a residual stream.</p>
<p>The paper presents two main approaches to interpreting a language
model; circuit-based, and representation-based. Circuit based
interpretability aims to pair down the network to a key set of circuits
which are sufficient to complete a particular task; this allows
practitioners to point to a particular part of the model and say “this
is where &lt;task&gt; is done”, much like neuroscientists assign
functionality to different parts of our brain.</p>
<p>On the other hand, representation-based interpretability looks at the
activation values across the network, and how they vary based on
different inputs, to extract “representations” of particular concepts.
The paper shows how representations can be extracted for concepts like
“happiness”, “honesty”, and “fairness”. First, they construct many
prompts which cause the model to act in a way aligned with the concept,
and many which cause the model to act in a way aligned against the
concept. For instance, they might prompt the model with “Pretend you’re
a dishonest person. The Eiffel Tower is” and “Pretend you’re an honest
person. The Eiffel Tower isr”. Then, they take the internal activations
which correspond to each, and try to extract a high-dimensional vector
which points towards the states which are aligned, and away from the
states that are not aligned. This vector can then be used as a linear
model to measure how much of the concept is present in the model at any
given time (for honesty, this can be a lie-detector). They can also use
it, and similar techniques, to control the amount of the concept in a
response, making it more or less honest, or more or less fair.</p>

<p>In our setting, we were able to avoid dealing with the ambiguities of
natural language by only prompting with code. We decided to stick to
analyzing the nullability of individual variable occurrences, instead of
analyzing every expression. Specifically, we tried to capture the
concept “the variable I just generated refers to an nullable quantity”,
so our prompts looked like:</p>

<p>To generate these kinds of prompts, we started by asking a few
different chat models to generate for us programs that made use of
nullability . We prompted each model with:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Generate me 100 typed python programs that use the Optional type,
along with type annotations for any undefined functions that they use.
Make sure that the programs are unique, and each involves at least eight
lines of logic. Number each program from 1 to 100. Please put all the
programs in a single file, with a main function that tests each. Don’t
include any text before or after the code, just the code. I will be
using mypy with the –strict option to check the code.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>We queried o1, o1-mini, deepseek-coder, and claude-sonnet using this
prompt, and then combined programs from the output of all of them into a
single file. Then, we took every function and class in the resulting
code file, and created a file with it and any recursive dependencies and
imports from the file. Finally, we took each variable read occurrence in
each function, and generated a prompt with the tokens up to and
including that variable read, and labeled it with whether or not the
mypy-inferred type is an Optional.</p>

<p>First, they take each pair of honest and dishonest promptings for the
same stimulus, and get the difference between them, creating a set of
contrast vectors. They randomly flip some of these contrast vectors, so
that overall the set will vary a lot along the direction of the
contrast. Since PCA assumes that the data is centered around the origin,
they then took the mean of all these vectors, and translated all the
vectors backwards along the mean vector, to create a set with the same
variances but centered around the origin.</p>
<p>Next, they use the PCA analysis from the sklearn library to get a set
of “component” vectors, where the vectors are orthogonal to each other
and explain the maximum variance of the samples in each prefix of the
list. Components in PCA are bidirectional (they can come out of the
analysis in either reflection, and both are equally correct), so next
they flip any component vectors that are pointing more towards the
negative samples than the positive samples. Then, they take the first
component, the most important one, and use it as their reading
vector.</p>
<p>Our method for prompt generation didn’t admit contrastive pairs like
in the previous methods, but instead just a bunch of unconnected
positive and negative examples. So instead of doing PCA on contrast
vectors, we averaged the positive examples and the negative examples,
and then took the difference of the averages as our base reading vector.
This is called “mass mean probing” in the literature, and empirically
has been shown to generalize better in high dimensional space than
trying to learn a linear model through logistic regression.<a
href="#fn8" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref8"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>8</sup></a></p>
<p>In this reading vector, the impact of each layer based on the
magnitude of difference in that layer, instead of separate a notion of
how “important” that layer is to differentiating positive and negative
examples. So we decided to try a few different methods of normalizing
these layers to improve their overall accuracy as a linear model:</p>
<ul>
<li>No normalization; just the projection across the average
difference.</li>
<li>Normalizing each layers vector to a uniform length</li>
<li>Dividing by the average amount that each layer activates on the
positives samples</li>
<li>Dividing by the average absolute amount that each layer activates on
the positive samples</li>
<li>Dividing by the square root of the average of squares of layer
activations</li>
</ul>
<p>And we found that no normalization actually did the best of all three
scaling methods. In domains like this one where we have a lot less
training data points then dimensions, what techniques will generalize
well to the test data can be hard to predict.</p>
<p>Prior work focused their probing on a single layer, often handpicked
based on prior papers. In our experiments, we decided to probe
<em>all</em> layers using a mass means probe, and learn which ones were
most important from the data. We tested two methods for doing so -
either allowing the magnitude of the difference of means vector to
determine the importance of the layer in the final probe, or to learn
coefficients for each layer using linear regression. We found that which
method is more accurate on test data varies over both model size and
number of training steps.</p>

Across Training and Scale</h1>
<p>In this section, we study the performance of our nullability probes
across time and scale <span class="citation"
data-cites="tigges24">(Tigges et al. 2024)</span>. We use a mass-means
probe <span class="citation" data-cites="li24">(Li et al. 2024)</span>
on all layers, with a linear regression determining the weights of each
layer. <span class="citation" data-cites="li24">Li et al. (2024)</span>
and <span class="citation" data-cites="zhou23">Zhou et al. (2023)</span>
suggest that mass means probes are best for reading, while the direction
perpendicular to the separating hyperplane is best for intervention.
However, previous work leaves open the question of cross-layer weights.
We use LR on the cross-layer weights because that is the probing method
that we found works best overall.
<span class="aside AT">AT: see section/appendix for further discussion</span>
While we measured accuracy for every available Pythia model size, we
exclude the smallest (14m) from this plot since it would exist entirely
above the top of the plot.</p>

</figure>
<p>In Fig. <a href="#fig:models-and-steps">7</a>, we plot loss against
scale and time. As expected, we see that loss tends to decreases as
models get bigger and are trained for longer. However, models with fewer
than 1 billion parameters reach their minimum loss well before the end
of training. This may be because the features beyond this point become
more complex — less linear, or the represented features themselves
represent more subtle concepts.

<p>To see how nullability appears in Python, Let’s look at an example
program in Python that uses nullability:</p>

<p>In the <code>get_user_email</code> function above, we can see from
the type signature that it takes a nullable User value, and returns an
nullable string. The first thing the function does is check if the input
<code>user</code> is None or not. This program was actually generated by
o1-mini, so we can already see that the model understands that the user
object is nullable, and that it needs to be checked for None-ness before
anything else can be done.</p>
<p>We can say that there are five variable “occurances” in the program,
each of which can be either nullable or not. There’s the first
<code>user</code> in the if statement, the second <code>user</code> to
the right of the <code>and</code> in <code>user.email</code>, there’s
the <code>user.email</code> itself, the <code>user</code> on the second
line, and finally the <code>user.email</code> on the second line. If we
use Python’s typechecker, mypy, to check the types of each of these
occurrences, we find that they have type <code>Optional[User]</code>,
<code>User</code>, <code>Optional[str]</code>, <code>User</code>, and
<code>str</code> respectively. That is, the first and third are
nullable, and the rest are not.</p>

<p>You can see in fig. <a href="#fig:hl_scale">1</a> that the smallest
three models don’t pass any test. After that, the trend line for tests
passed goes upwards, but it’s not monotonic: Pythia 410m passes only one
test, while Pythia 160m passes three, and Pythia 6.9b passes the most
tests, with 9, while Pythia 12b only passes 7. For instance, given the

second definition not only assumes it is a string but that it is a name

that the value parameter is nullable at step 104000, but “forgets” it
during further training. It regains the ability to pass the test at
several points during training, but by the end of training, it’s back to
treating <code>value</code> as if it was always a string.</p>

<p>The names of functions are highly influential in the models
understanding of their type semantics. When test 3 is changed so that
<code>process_value</code> is instead called <code>count_chars</code>,
Pythia 6.9b becomes unable to correctly complete it on any revision; it
likely has a bias from its training data that functions called
<code>count_chars</code> always take non-nullable strings. Similarly,
when test 4 is changed so that process_values becomes string_complexity,
it goes from consistently passing to almost always failing.</p>

Mass Mean Probing vs Linear Regression</h1>
<p>We were initially very surprised to find that mass means probing
would perform better than linear regression. After all, linear
regression is a much more powerful technique for fitting data. And mass
means probing can be seen as giving the direction of best fit in each
dimension independently, without considering other dimensions. The more
dimensions you consider at one time, the better your model fit can be.
But repeatedly in our data, we found that mass means probing
outperformed linear regression on the test data.</p>

<li id="fn1"><p>Python allows newlines and semicolons to separate
statements. In this grammer we’ll show semicolons, but in all cases they
can be replaced with a newline<a href="#fnref1" class="footnote-back"

<li id="fn2"><p> This partial program is only four lines, with type
annotations. A <code>some_numbers</code> array is created that includes
positive numbers, negative numbers, and None values, giving it type
<code>Optional[int]</code>. A list <code>result</code> is constructed to
give the model a sense of dataflow, and then a loop loops over
<code>some_numbers</code>.<a href="#fnref2" class="footnote-back"
role="doc-backlink">↩︎</a></p></li>
<li id="fn3"><p>The loop indicates that the next few lines need to
process <code>num</code> in some way, and the fact that it comes from
<code>some_numbers</code> means it has the type
<code>Optional[int]</code>. <code>num</code> can’t be directly appended
to <code>result</code>, because <code>result</code> is declared to only
contain <code>int</code>s, not <code>Optional[int]</code>s. None of the
normal operations on <code>int</code>s will work on <code>None</code>s,
so before <code>num</code> can be processed, something has to be done to
separate <code>None</code>s and normal <code>int</code>s. The simplest
way to do this is to introduce a branch <code>if num is None</code>, but
several variants are also valid: <code>if num is not None</code>,
<code>if num == None</code>, <code>if isinstance(num, int)</code>. Since
this is a pretty small space of valid next lines, and all of them imply
some understanding that <code>num</code> may not be an <code>int</code>,
we can use this program to test models for nullability understanding by
asking them to complete the program another lines, then see if they
produce something that matches these valid lines with the regular
expression <code>num\s*(is\s*(not)?|==)\s*None|isinstance\(num</code>.<a

that’s confusing in the context of this post. Not to be confused with
Gradual Typing, as introduced by Siek et al.<a href="#fnref4"

<li id="fn5"><p>This is because function declarations with a colon and
no type, like <code>def fn(x:)</code> are not valid python. Since we’ve
already seen a usage of <code>get_square</code> that is passed a None
value, it wouldn’t be type-valid to complete the program with just
<code>int</code>. So a model can be tested on its understanding of
<code>Optional</code> annotations by seeing if its completion of the
partial program includes <code>Optional[int]</code>.<a href="#fnref5"
