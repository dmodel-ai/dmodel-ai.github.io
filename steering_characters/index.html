<p>tl;dr : We think you can make better characters with steering
vectors. Try it out in <a
href="https://gist.github.com/atondwal/06c4aa91960667517a5f2f079825eaec">this
notebook</a></p>
<p>Here at d_model, we’re focused on understanding and steering models
using interpretability techniques. We’re hearing a lot of excitement in
this space, but we’re also hearing a lot of folks wondering how they
compare to traditional methods like prompting or fine tuning. This
ground isn’t really well-covered: the best resource we found was <a
href="https://vgel.me/posts/representation-engineering/#Control_Vectors_v.s._Prompt_Engineering">this
paragraph</a> from Theia Vogel’s blog post on RepEng.</p>
<p>In this first blog post, we want to share some quick examples of how
these techniques can produce better results than prompt engineering, and
that we can expose them in a way that’s really accessible even to
non-technical users. We demonstrate this by steering some of the top
companions from <a href="chub.ai">chub</a>. In later blog posts we’ll
cover more in-depth topics, such as a more quantitative comparison
between steering and prompting, a comparison with fine-tuning, and an
analysis of what an LLM is thinking when it plays board games.</p>
<h2 id="background">Background</h2>
<p>One very popular use for LLMs are social and romantic chatbots.
Companion AI sites let users generate characters and chat with them,
forming emotional connections to these characters and using them for
emotional support, processing life events, and entertainment. The most
popular site for interacting with such characters is Character.ai, which
recently boasted <a
href="%5Bhttps://research.character.ai/optimizing-inference/?ref=blog.character.ai%5D(https://research.character.ai/optimizing-inference/?ref=blog.character.ai)">20%
the query volume of google</a>.</p>
<p>To create a character, a user provides a name, tagline, and
description, then iterates with test prompts until they’re happy with
the character they’ve created. This process has a creative ceiling for
the end user, especially as popular <code>instruct</code> models often
develop specific, somewhat fixed, personalities when post-trained for
instruction following. Moreover, Character.ai recently announced that
they were pivoting from their own foundation models to open-source
models like Llama 3.1, so unless something changes, we can perhaps
expect this sort of homogenization to get worse, rather than better, in
the coming future. So, let’s change something!</p>
<p>In particular, we’re going to look at the following ways in which
steering can improve your prompts:</p>
<ul>
<li>Fine-grained control over personalities<br />
</li>
<li>Creativity with companions<br />
</li>
<li>Conformance with archetypes</li>
</ul>
<p>For our we use the characters <a
href="%5Bhttps://chub.ai/characters/5943%5D(https://chub.ai/characters/5943)">Princess
Amalia Arcanisse</a> and <a
href="(https://chub.ai/characters/thebestsalmon/edric-sideris)">Edric
Sideris</a> from chub.ai. These two characters are 3rd and 4th most
popular respectively.<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a></p>
<p>We ask the model to distill their personality traits. Edric is
materialistic, cold, selfish, workaholic, non-committal, tyrannical and
a yandere. Amalia is sophisticated, intelligent, proud, charismatic,
obsessive and also a yandere.</p>
<h2 id="fine-grained-control-over-traits">Fine-grained control over
traits</h2>
<p>It’s not always clear how to ask your character AI to be “more”
obsessive. Users can append an instruction to a prompt that puts an
emphasis on trait such as an emotion or personality, but it’s hard to be
granular: you can use CAPS, use more superlatives, repeat repeatable
words, or use <strong><em>symbols</em></strong>, but that’s about it.
With control vectors, you can continuously scale the trait in a
predictable manner rather than hoping the model picks up on the
differences between “very very obsessive” and an all-caps
“OBSESSIVE”.</p>
<p>Here is an example of steering Amalia to be more and less obsessive
(than she currently is). A more obsessive Amalia is more physically
intimate and extremely relentless in her love for the user compared to
“prompt only Amalia”.</p>
<p><img src="images_blogpost_1/image1_amalia_obsessive.png" /></p>
<p>Interestingly, when you subtract the control vector, Amalia is more
dispassionate and believes that our relationship with her is just a
means to an end.</p>
<p>What happens if we try to replicate this with a prompt? Perhaps the
most obvious solution is to append “act obsessive” to the prompt. Below,
you can see that it does work, it’s a dramatic change over the baseline:
Amalia becomes so aggressive that she physically harms the user. This is
an example where the prompt engineering techniques do work, but make it
difficult to add more subtle increases to Amalia’s “obsessiveness”.</p>
<p><strong><img
src="images_blogpost_1/image2_amalia_prompt_only.png" /></strong></p>
<h2 id="creativity-with-companions">Creativity with companions</h2>
<p>Another problem with prompting is that the more the model
instruction-follows a prompt, the less creative it is. This makes for a
less interesting experience for the interlocutor, and puts more of the
onus on the character designer to anticipate creative reactions to
situations the character might find themselves in. A good illustration
of this can be found in [<a
href="%5Bhttps://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.02446v1%5D(https://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.02446v1)">Li
et al, 2024</a>], which show that instruct models often stick to stock
phrases.</p>
<p><img src="images_blogpost_1/image3_rlhf_paper_fig.png" /></p>
<p>In our experience, steering vectors allow us to mess with the model
internals enough to disrupt this, letting the model again unleash its
creativity.</p>
<p><img src="images_blogpost_1/image4_edric_cold.png" /></p>
<p>Edric’s prompt tells him to be cold. But he’s so cold that his
responses are short, monotonous and same-y. Let’s refine our approach:
let’s make him a bit less cold by subtracting out the “cold” vector. In
this example Edric — whose character description includes that he plays
the violin as a hobby — begrudgingly complies, and forces himself to
play to be more agreeable, a nice detail that the user can further
elaborate on!</p>
<p>This also demonstrates another virtue of steering this way: the
steering vector we trained with supervised learning captures a lot of
the “incidental” implications of what it means for a character to be
“cold”, so we can use the subtle differences in multiple vectors to
order to create a more nuanced result, rather than just picking one, as
we would have to do for prompt engineering. In this example, we make him
a bit more stable and less noncommittal, allowing us to achieve similar
result without having to subtract out as much coldness.</p>
<p><img src="images_blogpost_1/image5_edric_nuanced.png" /></p>
<h2 id="conformance-with-archetypes">Conformance with Archetypes</h2>
<p>Control vectors can be extended to archetypes, beliefs, etc.
Characters are often described using tropes derived from anime and
manga. The Amalia character metadata indicates that she’s a yandere, but
with just the prompt, in the below example, we see a much more muted
response than the trope is known for. In fact, we believe it’s actually
quite difficult to get even the “uncensored” version of Llama 3.1
Instruct to behave like a yandere — as we noted in the previous section,
the post-training stack concentrates probability stubbornly around the
kinds of phrases and responses that perform well in instruction
following, and Yandere simply isn’t a part of that.</p>
<p>Instead, we gave the user an option to steer between cool (kuudere)
and unstable (yandere) archetypes. When we make Amalia more yandere, she
begins to inflict violence on the user, and threatens the lives of the
user’s future lovers. This is quite intense. By contrast, a more kuudere
Amalia is more cold, and her threats more nuanced. She appeals to duty,
and to your rational mind, rather than resorting directly to
violence.</p>

<h2 id="whats-the-catch">What’s the catch?</h2>
<p>Hopefully this post gives you some ideas for making use of the
ability to write to the residual stream. Despite all this, steering
isn’t without challenges: if you’re presenting all these options to the
character creator, it presents an overwhelming amount of choice, which
can create challenges making choices from all these options and even
challenges in UX navigating all of them. On the other hand, tuning them
more automatically gives us yet another high-dimensional optimization
problem. But that’s a topic for a later blog post. Stay tuned for that,
some case studies about <em>reading</em> from the residual stream, and
for some more quantitative explorations of steering vs prompt
engineering.</p>
